# String instrument hacking guide

> Find which string to purchase if you want to hack your string instrument to play a certain note, without changing the string tension too much.

## TL;DR

```bash
git clone https://github.com/b1f6c1c4/strings.git
cd strings
npm i
node index.js
```

Just answer the questions:

1. What instrument?
1. What size?
1. What note do you want to play on the desired open string?
